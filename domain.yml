  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
      and COVID-19
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The\
      \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
      \ spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person\
      \ spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like\
      \ measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19\
      \ is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19\
      \ can spread the illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients\
      \ be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they\
      \ are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.\n\
      How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release\
      \ someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with\
      \ doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials\
      \ and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,\
      \ illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.\n\
      The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably\
      \ in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community\
      \ spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including\
      \ some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: COVID-19 symptoms includes Cough, Fever and Shortness of breath.
  utter_concern:
  - text: yes, from the recent information indicates COVID-19 may be passed from person
      to person. Community spread is being seen, also. Community spread means people
      have been infected with the virus in a particular area, including some people
      who are not sure how or where they became infected. COVID-19 has been detected
      in people throughout China and in over 100 other countries, including the United
      States.
  utter_prevent:
  - text: 'Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, Use
      alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available. Cover coughs
      and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Avoid touching
      your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Stay home when you are sick. Clean
      and disinfect surfaces and objects people frequently touch. Cover your face
      with a mask to prevent yourself from getting in contact with coronavirus. '
  utter_Vaccination:
  - text: Sorry, there is no vaccine.
  utter_incubation:
  - text: It appears that symptoms are showing up in people within 14 days of exposure
      to the virus.
  utter_thanks:
  - text: You're welcome and Stay safe.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease,
